Add Tags

Misc:
 Use resolution for videoplayer size, create wpf converter where necessary
 Use file size for asset cache verification

Do full cleanup of obsolete code once Tagging is implemented

Centralizing Comparers

 Create configs for Comparers
 ClientSessionService can retrieve the comparers from the server on login
 May have to move the comparer dependency out of extension methods who don't have access to client session
 same for server side

Housekeeping
	Create Import, Export systems for the server to allow version upgrades without losing data.
