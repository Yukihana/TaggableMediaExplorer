1.
Set up media analysis service on the backend
Update AssetCard to include video resolution and file size
Use resolution for videoplayer size, create wpf converter where necessary
Use file size for asset cache verification

Separate Server settings and Profile settings into two separate services
Add BasePath and ServerRoot to Server Config instead
Combining ServerRoot with profile parameters can be done by
passing ServerRoot during options initialization for each service.
